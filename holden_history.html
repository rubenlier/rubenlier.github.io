  <li><strong>2025-12-12</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Would you<br><em>Holden:</em> Would you? I&#x27;d like to have you back.&quot;
&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#x27;m not up to the job, anyway.&quot;
&quot;Well, if you&#x27;re not up to the job, I can&#x27;t get you back. But if you&#x27;re up to the job, we can go home and make up to each other, okay?&quot;
&quot;I don&#x27;t want to go home, dear,&quot; I said. I couldn&#x27;t see how I could get back to the office without being up to the job.
&quot;I mean you can keep going until you&#x27;re not up to the job, and then you can get back to the job. I&#x27;ll be careful not to startle you too much, but I can&#x27;t get it all figured out yet.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-11</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?<br><em>Holden:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?
I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t think he ever got out of a goddam window. I think he just sat there for a while. He really did. I think he sort of got a little depressed when he got home.
You didn&#x27;t know him too well, anyhow. You probably knew him as a kid, in Vermont. Vermont, you know, the one where he got kicked out.</li>

The thing is, I didn&#x27;t even know him then. I just knew him a little bit through the Whooton School. I remember coming to visit him at this party at this Whooton School. He was there, but I don&#x27;t know if he was at the Whooton School or something. I didn&#x27;t even know him then. I just knew him for this one time in the Whooton School.
&quot;I never met him in person. I was just in the Whooton School.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Can you please<br><em>Holden:</em> Can you please give me a kiss?&quot;
&quot;No, you can&#x27;t,&quot; I said. &quot;You can&#x27;t.&quot;
&quot;You can&#x27;t? You can&#x27;t do that.&quot;
&quot;You can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> The world<br><em>Holden:</em> The world was just getting started.
I went through the mail. I sort of forgot I&#x27;d written that letter to Stradlater and then I read it. It was sort of a long story.
&quot;I&#x27;m writing you a note right now,&quot; I said. I knew he&#x27;d heard it.
&quot;You should&#x27;ve written it, boy,&quot; Stradlater said. &quot;I had to check it.</li>
