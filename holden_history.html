  <li><strong>2025-12-10</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Can you please<br><em>Holden:</em> Can you please give me a kiss?&quot;
&quot;No, you can&#x27;t,&quot; I said. &quot;You can&#x27;t.&quot;
&quot;You can&#x27;t? You can&#x27;t do that.&quot;
&quot;You can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> The world<br><em>Holden:</em> The world was just getting started.
I went through the mail. I sort of forgot I&#x27;d written that letter to Stradlater and then I read it. It was sort of a long story.
&quot;I&#x27;m writing you a note right now,&quot; I said. I knew he&#x27;d heard it.
&quot;You should&#x27;ve written it, boy,&quot; Stradlater said. &quot;I had to check it.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> The museum<br><em>Holden:</em> The museum is the oldest building in the world. It&#x27;s over 2,000 years old. It was built by Phoebe and her brothers. They didn&#x27;t know how to build a house. They just took out the old brick and put a floor and a board on top of it. That&#x27;s all they did. It&#x27;s one of the biggest, most beautiful buildings in the world. It&#x27;s very important because it was built in a time when the sky was blue and everybody could see in it.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-08</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> I was<br><em>Holden:</em> I was afraid he&#x27;d come over and take me home,&quot; I said.
&quot;Oh, very funny,&quot; he said. &quot;Why don&#x27;tcha go in that room and get dressed first, then? I&#x27;ll be up all night.&quot;
&quot;Sure,&quot; I said. I got dressed and went in the room. He kept calling me &quot;the lucky one.&quot;
He had a pretty good bed, though. He was laying on it in the middle of the bed, with his legs way up and all.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-08</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> I want to<br><em>Holden:</em> I want to thank you so much for the advice,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#x27;m really glad you asked me to stop by.&quot;
She looked up at me. &quot;You&#x27;re one of the most extraordinary guys I&#x27;ve ever met,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#x27;re really an astoundingly witty guy.&quot;
&quot;I am, thank you so much. I really am,&quot; I said. I put down my tray and went into the room.</li>
