  <li><strong>2025-12-20 22:44</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> I was waiting at the bus stop when<br><em>Holden:</em> I was waiting at the bus stop when the driver saw me, and I got out of the cab. I had to have a cigarette. I could hardly concentrate on holding the cigarette in my hand. It was so cold and damp out, and I was sweating all over. I was all out. I was hoping I&#x27;d have a cigarette or two when all of a sudden this guy, Mr. Spencer, came up to me and said, &quot;Who&#x27;s this boy you&#x27;re standing next to?&quot; I said I was sitting next to him. He said, &quot;You&#x27;re sitting next to this kid.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-14 17:47</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Are you the one who I was<br><em>Holden:</em> Are you the one who I was talking to the whole time?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I&#x27;m the one that&#x27;s the son of a bitch.&quot;
&quot;You&#x27;re a little young to be a son of a bitch, are ya?&quot;
&quot;No, I&#x27;m not.&quot; I didn&#x27;t feel like it, though. I was too tired to think of anything. &quot;Hey. What&#x27;s the matter with you?&quot; I asked her.
She just stared at me for a while, and then she sort of gave me this little shrug. Then she put her hand over her mouth and sort of waddled over to the bed and sat down on it.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-14 11:03</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Will you do me the favor of<br><em>Holden:</em> Will you do me the favor of standing up for a minute?&quot; I said.
&quot;Sure,&quot; she said.
&quot;Holden, give me your hand,&quot; I said. She was a very nice girl. I&#x27;m not kidding. She was. &quot;Holden, give me your hand.&quot;
She took my hand, and then she went up to the kitchen.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-14 10:49</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> What a beautiful day, the sun is<br><em>Holden:</em> What a beautiful day, the sun is out.&quot;
&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful, too,&quot; I said. I knew he was going to say something about the sun going out, but I didn&#x27;t care. All I wanted to do was go back to the hotel and get my coat. I didn&#x27;t even feel like getting dressed.
Then, just before I got back to the hotel, I took this look at old Antolini. He was still on his bed, with his mouth open, looking at the sky. The sun was out, and he looked so happy, and all that crap.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-12 17:42</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Would you<br><em>Holden:</em> Would you? I&#x27;d like to have you back.&quot;
&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#x27;m not up to the job, anyway.&quot;
&quot;Well, if you&#x27;re not up to the job, I can&#x27;t get you back. But if you&#x27;re up to the job, we can go home and make up to each other, okay?&quot;
&quot;I don&#x27;t want to go home, dear,&quot; I said. I couldn&#x27;t see how I could get back to the office without being up to the job.
&quot;I mean you can keep going until you&#x27;re not up to the job, and then you can get back to the job. I&#x27;ll be careful not to startle you too much, but I can&#x27;t get it all figured out yet.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-11 15:59</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?<br><em>Holden:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?
I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t think he ever got out of a goddam window. I think he just sat there for a while. He really did. I think he sort of got a little depressed when he got home.
You didn&#x27;t know him too well, anyhow. You probably knew him as a kid, in Vermont. Vermont, you know, the one where he got kicked out.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-11 15:58</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?<br><em>Holden:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?
The thing is, I didn&#x27;t even know him then. I just knew him a little bit through the Whooton School. I remember coming to visit him at this party at this Whooton School. He was there, but I don&#x27;t know if he was at the Whooton School or something. I didn&#x27;t even know him then. I just knew him for this one time in the Whooton School.
&quot;I never met him in person. I was just in the Whooton School.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10 10:14</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Can you please<br><em>Holden:</em> Can you please give me a kiss?&quot;
&quot;No, you can&#x27;t,&quot; I said. &quot;You can&#x27;t.&quot;
&quot;You can&#x27;t? You can&#x27;t do that.&quot;
&quot;You can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10 09:54</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> The world<br><em>Holden:</em> The world was just getting started.
I went through the mail. I sort of forgot I&#x27;d written that letter to Stradlater and then I read it. It was sort of a long story.
&quot;I&#x27;m writing you a note right now,&quot; I said. I knew he&#x27;d heard it.
&quot;You should&#x27;ve written it, boy,&quot; Stradlater said. &quot;I had to check it.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10 09:51</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> The museum<br><em>Holden:</em> The museum is the oldest building in the world. It&#x27;s over 2,000 years old. It was built by Phoebe and her brothers. They didn&#x27;t know how to build a house. They just took out the old brick and put a floor and a board on top of it. That&#x27;s all they did. It&#x27;s one of the biggest, most beautiful buildings in the world. It&#x27;s very important because it was built in a time when the sky was blue and everybody could see in it.</li>
