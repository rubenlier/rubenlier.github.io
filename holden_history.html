  <li><strong>2025-12-08</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> I was<br><em>Holden:</em> I was afraid he&#x27;d come over and take me home,&quot; I said.
&quot;Oh, very funny,&quot; he said. &quot;Why don&#x27;tcha go in that room and get dressed first, then? I&#x27;ll be up all night.&quot;
&quot;Sure,&quot; I said. I got dressed and went in the room. He kept calling me &quot;the lucky one.&quot;
He had a pretty good bed, though. He was laying on it in the middle of the bed, with his legs way up and all.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-08</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> I want to<br><em>Holden:</em> I want to thank you so much for the advice,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#x27;m really glad you asked me to stop by.&quot;
She looked up at me. &quot;You&#x27;re one of the most extraordinary guys I&#x27;ve ever met,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#x27;re really an astoundingly witty guy.&quot;
&quot;I am, thank you so much. I really am,&quot; I said. I put down my tray and went into the room.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-06</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Hey there<br><em>Holden:</em> Hey there, babe. You look so beautiful.&quot;
&quot;I am.&quot; I said. I was feeling so damn sleepy.
&quot;Well, you look wonderful. Don&#x27;t you think? I mean if you don&#x27;t feel like being in the bath with me, you can go home. You don&#x27;t have to stay in bed any more.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-06</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Phoebe made a joke and it killed me<br><em>Holden:</em> Phoebe made a joke and it killed me. &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I might. I might go out to a movie with the family tonight and see The Producers or something. I&#x27;m not too crazy about movies. I mean I&#x27;m not crazy about them too much. But I like The Producers,&quot; she said. She was always talking about The Producers.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-06</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Phoebe made a joke and it killed me<br><em>Holden:</em> Phoebe made a joke and it killed me, but it made me sadder than when she said it.
&quot;It is too late for that,&quot; I said. &quot;But I&#x27;d hate to have her in the first place. If she&#x27;d been a goddam playmate and all, she&#x27;d be a real hit. You&#x27;re right. She was a playmate once. I&#x27;m not kidding.&quot;
&quot;She was a playmate.</li>
