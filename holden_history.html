  <li><strong>2025-12-11</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?<br><em>Holden:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?
I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t think he ever got out of a goddam window. I think he just sat there for a while. He really did. I think he sort of got a little depressed when he got home.
You didn&#x27;t know him too well, anyhow. You probably knew him as a kid, in Vermont. Vermont, you know, the one where he got kicked out.</li>

The thing is, I didn&#x27;t even know him then. I just knew him a little bit through the Whooton School. I remember coming to visit him at this party at this Whooton School. He was there, but I don&#x27;t know if he was at the Whooton School or something. I didn&#x27;t even know him then. I just knew him for this one time in the Whooton School.
&quot;I never met him in person. I was just in the Whooton School.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Can you please<br><em>Holden:</em> Can you please give me a kiss?&quot;
&quot;No, you can&#x27;t,&quot; I said. &quot;You can&#x27;t.&quot;
&quot;You can&#x27;t? You can&#x27;t do that.&quot;
&quot;You can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> The world<br><em>Holden:</em> The world was just getting started.
I went through the mail. I sort of forgot I&#x27;d written that letter to Stradlater and then I read it. It was sort of a long story.
&quot;I&#x27;m writing you a note right now,&quot; I said. I knew he&#x27;d heard it.
&quot;You should&#x27;ve written it, boy,&quot; Stradlater said. &quot;I had to check it.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-10</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> The museum<br><em>Holden:</em> The museum is the oldest building in the world. It&#x27;s over 2,000 years old. It was built by Phoebe and her brothers. They didn&#x27;t know how to build a house. They just took out the old brick and put a floor and a board on top of it. That&#x27;s all they did. It&#x27;s one of the biggest, most beautiful buildings in the world. It&#x27;s very important because it was built in a time when the sky was blue and everybody could see in it.</li>
