  <li><strong>2025-12-29 19:58</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> The capital of the Netherlands is named<br><em>Holden:</em> The capital of the Netherlands is named Vincenza, in honor. It&#x27;s also about this place where you can buy a pint of water on Sunday and have it ready for four-thousand people--all these very poor kids that are all over at the game. And if they want a drink while sitting there, old Sally gets them to take off their shoes right on top so nobody breaks any goddam ankles or anything.&quot;
Old Ackley kept talking while he drank his beer out of my handbag again from my coat pocket because I had one more thing left in me but something else with him besides Scotch. He was always thinking how much better he&#x27;d be getting some other stuff when the war ended than now. That&#x27;s why he still keeps picturing what he might do after he got home. &quot;What&#x27;s your name?&quot; he said finally just to show me he cared as hell being around me every minute even though he didn&#x27;t know my real name yet anyway without telling anybody who he really thought played golf or tennis or whatever would play tennis or tennis somewhere.
&quot;I don&#x27; like saying my own damn name.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-25 11:13</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Do you ever wonder why<br><em>Holden:</em> Do you ever wonder why so many women don&#x27;t wear anything with a little bit of lace on it? Because they think if they do, no one&#x27;ll know. Or because the lace is just plain ugly. It&#x27;s really annoying.
Anyway I got out of bed and did what everybody does in the morning--I took my bath or something then,&quot; she said to me before I finished brushing my teeth again.&quot;You&#x27;re going to sleep like that?&quot; old Sally said all of sudden while putting her hand up to dry.
&quot;Yeah. What?&quot; She was still combing her hair. &quot;Where are your hands?&quot; Her goddam thumb was bleeding from all over this whole area where hers used be.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-24 20:41</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> would you please tell me whether<br><em>Holden:</em> would you please tell me whether I should put my finger on the button again?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. She didn&#x27;t sound too happy. &quot;How do we get to Broadway, then? Or any other place that has a big screen and all--I mean where there&#x27;s no rush or anything?&quot; The only thing I could think of was maybe going up Fifth Avenue with a couple buddies, for God sakes! It seemed so easy when we were sitting there in her goddam dressing room getting ready each morning. And it was very late. You can hardly even make out anybody around anywhere. Where would they go at night if they got back from school and came down here for lunch one day after their vacation ended anyway?&#x27; That sorta killed old Sally whenever somebody asked about it like an idiot sometimes . Anyway what made things worse is that everything started looking pretty dreadful before we left the barroom—the way our lips parted and all because everybody had stopped eating, without making eye contact or saying hello or anything either..</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-20 22:44</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> I was waiting at the bus stop when<br><em>Holden:</em> I was waiting at the bus stop when the driver saw me, and I got out of the cab. I had to have a cigarette. I could hardly concentrate on holding the cigarette in my hand. It was so cold and damp out, and I was sweating all over. I was all out. I was hoping I&#x27;d have a cigarette or two when all of a sudden this guy, Mr. Spencer, came up to me and said, &quot;Who&#x27;s this boy you&#x27;re standing next to?&quot; I said I was sitting next to him. He said, &quot;You&#x27;re sitting next to this kid.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-14 17:47</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Are you the one who I was<br><em>Holden:</em> Are you the one who I was talking to the whole time?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I&#x27;m the one that&#x27;s the son of a bitch.&quot;
&quot;You&#x27;re a little young to be a son of a bitch, are ya?&quot;
&quot;No, I&#x27;m not.&quot; I didn&#x27;t feel like it, though. I was too tired to think of anything. &quot;Hey. What&#x27;s the matter with you?&quot; I asked her.
She just stared at me for a while, and then she sort of gave me this little shrug. Then she put her hand over her mouth and sort of waddled over to the bed and sat down on it.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-14 11:03</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Will you do me the favor of<br><em>Holden:</em> Will you do me the favor of standing up for a minute?&quot; I said.
&quot;Sure,&quot; she said.
&quot;Holden, give me your hand,&quot; I said. She was a very nice girl. I&#x27;m not kidding. She was. &quot;Holden, give me your hand.&quot;
She took my hand, and then she went up to the kitchen.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-14 10:49</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> What a beautiful day, the sun is<br><em>Holden:</em> What a beautiful day, the sun is out.&quot;
&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful, too,&quot; I said. I knew he was going to say something about the sun going out, but I didn&#x27;t care. All I wanted to do was go back to the hotel and get my coat. I didn&#x27;t even feel like getting dressed.
Then, just before I got back to the hotel, I took this look at old Antolini. He was still on his bed, with his mouth open, looking at the sky. The sun was out, and he looked so happy, and all that crap.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-12 17:42</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> Would you<br><em>Holden:</em> Would you? I&#x27;d like to have you back.&quot;
&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#x27;m not up to the job, anyway.&quot;
&quot;Well, if you&#x27;re not up to the job, I can&#x27;t get you back. But if you&#x27;re up to the job, we can go home and make up to each other, okay?&quot;
&quot;I don&#x27;t want to go home, dear,&quot; I said. I couldn&#x27;t see how I could get back to the office without being up to the job.
&quot;I mean you can keep going until you&#x27;re not up to the job, and then you can get back to the job. I&#x27;ll be careful not to startle you too much, but I can&#x27;t get it all figured out yet.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-11 15:59</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?<br><em>Holden:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?
I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t think he ever got out of a goddam window. I think he just sat there for a while. He really did. I think he sort of got a little depressed when he got home.
You didn&#x27;t know him too well, anyhow. You probably knew him as a kid, in Vermont. Vermont, you know, the one where he got kicked out.</li>
  <li><strong>2025-12-11 15:58</strong><br><em>Prompt:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?<br><em>Holden:</em> What did John Lennon ever do to you?
The thing is, I didn&#x27;t even know him then. I just knew him a little bit through the Whooton School. I remember coming to visit him at this party at this Whooton School. He was there, but I don&#x27;t know if he was at the Whooton School or something. I didn&#x27;t even know him then. I just knew him for this one time in the Whooton School.
&quot;I never met him in person. I was just in the Whooton School.</li>
